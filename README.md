# CensusData

This project demonstrates OOP principles using the PHP language. It also demonstrates the ability to connect to a database and access data using SQL commands and a MySQL database.

Using XAMPP, create a "states" user with a "states" password (or update the states_db_constants with a username and password of your choosing). You can import the states.sql file in 
the data directory to create a local version of the database.
